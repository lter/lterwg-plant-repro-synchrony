# Deprecated Scripts

Any scripts in this folder are consider 'deprecated'. This means that they were useful at one point but hypotheses/methods shifted such that their reason for existing was abandoned or they were superseded by a script that is in the core workflow.

These scripts are preserved here for posterity rather than deleted but are non-critical to the evaluation of this work in its publishable form.
