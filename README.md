### Statistics Workflow

1. **`synchrony_stats_prep`** - Absorb tidied mast seeding data and do pre-statistics preparatory wrangling. Tidying scripts housed in a different repository and will be published on in a different paper

- **`synchrony_mrm`** - Performs multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM) to assess effect of species' traits on synchrony. Requires data produced by `synchrony_stats_prep`

- **`synchrony_perm-stats`** - Analyzes difference between observed and permuted correlations. Requires data produced by `synchrony_stats_prep`

- **`synchrony_anova`** - Performs permutation analysis of variance (perANOVA) to assess the effect of _each trait_ (<u>separately</u>) on synchrony. Requires data produced by `synchrony_stats_prep`
