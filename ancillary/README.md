# Ancillary Scripts

## Script Explanations

**`synchrony_stats-prep`** - Absorb tidied mast seeding data and do pre-statistics preparatory wrangling. Tidying scripts housed in a different repository and will be published on in a different paper. This script produces the data 'synchrony_pcoa_climate_combination.csv' that is needed in subsequent scripts.

### Plant Reproduction Google Drive (_Group Members <u>ONLY</u>_)

**`plant-repro_gdrive`** - Downloads needed data for each script from the group's Shared Google Drive and uploads each script's products to the Drive.
    - Note this is meant as a convenience for _working group members only_ as it requires access to the group's private Shared Google Drive
    - For those with Drive access, it enables "skipping" earlier scripts by downloading the version of pre-requisite data from the Drive rather than re-generating them locally
